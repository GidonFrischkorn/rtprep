# Apply the repository's branch model: merge settings, the default branch, the
# label that requests a Claude review, and the protection rulesets.

# Run it once `develop` exists on GitHub, and again whenever a file in
# .github/rulesets/ changes. It is idempotent: a ruleset whose name already
# exists on the remote is updated in place rather than duplicated.

#
# Requires the `gh` CLI, authenticated with an account that has admin rights
# on the repository (`gh auth status` must show the `repo` scope).
#
# WHY EACH BRANCH HAS TWO RULESETS. A bypass actor bypasses everything in a
# ruleset at once. Nobody can approve their own pull request, so while the
# package has one developer every merge needs the admin bypass for the
# approval rule, and in a single ruleset that bypass would also skip the
# required checks. The "review" ruleset holds only the approval requirement
# and can be bypassed on a pull request; the "gate" ruleset holds the checks,
# thread resolution, merge methods and history protection and has no bypass
# actors at all. Actor 5 / RepositoryRole is GitHub's base "admin" role.
#
# A repository admin can always edit or disable a ruleset in Settings > Rules,
# so nothing here can lock anyone out. That is also the emergency exit when a
# required check is broken for reasons outside the package.

Done. Confirm by hand:

  1. Every "must pass" context above matches a check name that actually runs
     on pull requests into that branch. A context that never reports leaves
     pull requests waiting for a check that will never arrive.
  2. The review rulesets show a bypass row for RepositoryRole id=5 in
     pull_request mode; the gate rulesets show "bypass: none".
  3. `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/rules/branches/develop` lists the rules of both
     the review and the gate ruleset.
